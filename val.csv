3949,Just started following recently. appreciate your willingness to share. I watched the video and learned a few things. Congrats on the $AMZN trade,Human
3950,$AMZN thinking AMZN is due for a bounce ? not so fast. It actually JUST broke key daily support and bigger sell off should begin.,Human
3951,Every dip in $AMZN has been a buying opportunity for for the last 15 years. I remember it dipping from 600 to 475. Now look. Not selling.,Human
3952,Even the products branded with the Amazon name are not actually produced by $AMZN.Bezos isn't trying to reinvent the wheel like Elon.,Human
3953,"If true, Shame on #Amazon for supporting Bigotry, Hate, Extremism and FGM. Hopefully this was an accident and it can be corrected.  $AMZN @JeffBezos",Human
3954,$AMZN should drop pretty hard today. If the VIX spirals out of control again we could see a 10% market correction like feb. Betting on that,Human
3955,"$AMZN it was expected to drop, since it been a bull market, investor are afraid of another market crash and selling at first sign of that.",Human
3956,$AMZN Becoming attractive but not now. More pain to come.  Would wait till it solidly bounces back towards its 50 day MA. Needs catalyst,Human
3957,$AMZN weekly 21 SMA of interest. If it doesn't hold - look for either 200 SMA on daily or 10 EMA on monthly. One step at a time.,Human
3958,"Keep in mind these $amzn levels. Already break down 1833. IF break down 1784, not impossible see extreme case 1700 later this month.",Human
3959,"AWS valuation is crazy. But given wafer-thin margins of $AMZN retail, that valuation is crazy too, regardless of its much lower multiple relative to revenues.",Human
3960,"$AMZN We are Family, All countries have their own Market BOT - Russia - China - US, Inc - We all have Bots congratulations to all we made it",Human
3961,"Amazon has made great strides to expand margins over the past several years, will be interesting to see the effect of wage increases . $AMZN",Human

3964,Looks like the same fkn pattern fri/mon/tue on this $AMZN squeeze in the 10am bounce in the 1pm candle today gonna be different?,Human
3965,"Puts were the right call this morning for a day to day play. If $AMZN closes red, this puppy is going much lower and those 1950 puts will be up huge",Human
3966,$AMZN Ric Santelli is a fucking savant among retards. A fucking renaissance man among remedials.  A LITTLE BIT IF INFLATION IS A GOOD THING!,Human
3967,"$AMZN ok call me crazy, but I think we get close to/above ATH by end of week. Reading in this SAP thing, it`s huge. Plus, rates fell today.",Human

3971,$Amzn see this is the problem with this stock. goes way too hard on the bounces then leaves nothing but a fade job intraday. frenzy stock,Human
3972,$AMZN watch it go right back to 2k by next week. Then I call manipulation. And BS. Stocks high so they come up with bs. Reason to drop it,Human

3976,"Yesterday's intraday action in $AMZN was a decent tell. go back and look at it, every time tried to take out early lows, buyers stepped up.",Human
3977,$AMZN The 1702 target was a nice entry point for a bounce. As i have said before targets usually are exhaustion points for the trend.,Human
3978,$AMZN looking good here.  If it can close in the next 4 min over 1793 we could find some good support for any 1800c into next week,Human
